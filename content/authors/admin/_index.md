I am a data science master's student who is interested in the data-centric study of social interactions and how these can be leveraged to bring about change. In this line of work, I have modelled the effect of team diversity in complex problem solving, studied how the pragmatics of conversations shape interpersonal alignment and investigated the potential for algorithms to monitor interactions on social media. Recently, I have picked up an interest in graph neural networks which I believe will play a key role in understanding large scale social data.

I am a creative entrepreneur by heart and have helped develop open-source natural language processing resources in danish and used the tools in my NLP-consulting start-up. Finally, I am passionate about social and environmental sustainability and have competed in several case competitions working towards sustainability.
