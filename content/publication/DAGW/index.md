abstract: Danish language technology has been hindered by a lack of broad-coverage corpora at the scale modern NLP prefers. This paper describes the Danish Gigaword Corpus, the result of a focused effort to provide a diverse and freely-available one billion word corpus of Danish text. The Danish Gigaword corpus covers a wide array of time periods, domains, speakers’ socio-economic status, and Danish dialects.
