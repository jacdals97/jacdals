abstract: In the midst of the Era of Big Data, tools for analysing and processing unstructured data are needed more  than  ever.  Being  among  these,  sentiment  analysis  has  experienced  both  a  substantial proliferation  in  popularity  and  major  developmental  progress.  However,  the  development  of sentiment analysis tools in Danish has not experienced the same rapid development as e.g. English tools.  Few  Danish  tools  exist,  and  often  the  ones  available  are  either  ineffective or  outdated. Moreover, authoritative validation tests in low-resource languages, are missing, which is why little can be deduced about the competence of current Danish models. We present SENTIDA, a simple and effective model for general sentiment analysis in Danish, and compare its competence to the current benchmark within the field of Danish sentiment analysis, AFINN. Combining a lexical approach with several incorporated functions, we construct SENTIDA and categorise it as a domain-independent sentiment analysis tool focusing on polarity strength. Subsequently, we run different validation tests, including a binary classification test of Trustpilot reviews and a correlation test based on manually rated texts from different domains. The results show that SENTIDA excels across all tests, predicting reviews  with  an  accuracy  above  80%  in  all  trials  and  providing  significant  correlations  with manually annotated texts.
